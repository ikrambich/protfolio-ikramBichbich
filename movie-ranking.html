<h1>My Best Movies For 2023:</h1>
<h2>Let's pick my best 3 movies only ....Let's get started.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Ice and Fire</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it shows that love can make the impossible possible even if the water and fire had to meet all together.</p>
<h3>Saw</h3>
<p> Unlike other horror movies this one takes in the entire scene of the detectives trying to catch the murder while you're trying to figure out what is going on. </p>
<h3>Mouse</h3>
<p> The cast , the story and mostly the direction with a matching bgm has made  the drama just unbeatable and historic.
  From its opening scene it will make your heart pounding, you are in for a thrill ride that keeps up its psychological horror and identity crisis until the final reveal/plot twist. </p>
